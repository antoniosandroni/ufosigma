# These tests check the functionality of the 'select_mean' option of Gaussian Thinning.
# The first test operates on some (40) randomly generated sea surface temperature observations,
# checking that the calculated means match the reference values calculated earlier.
# The second includes other_variable as one of the simulated variables, which would result in
# different locations being accepted if the filter acted on it - but the test checks that the
# filter is only applied to seaSurfaceTemperature (as above) and ignores other_variable, not
# rejecting any locations in the latter.
# While the first 2 tests have 'min_num_obs_per_bin' set, the third doesn't - it tests that the
# default value of 5 is used (note the spatial bins are the same as for the first 2 tests, but
# there is only 1 time bin instead of 2).
# The fourth test checks that the filter acts on the latest valid type - in this case, a
# derived obs value rather than obs value. Using the same spatial and temporal bins as the 3rd
# test, and default 5 min_num_obs_per_bin as well - this is compared to reference data with the 
# same transformation applied to it.
